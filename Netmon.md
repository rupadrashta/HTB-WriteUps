# HTB - Netmon

As usual, I started with an nmap scan.

```

Anonymous ftp is open. On port 80, Paessler PRTG bandwidth monitor is running. Since this box is named netmon, chances are we need to exploit some vulnerability in this service.

I tried anonymous ftp first.

```

Getting the user flag was easy. Let's see how to get admin access.
